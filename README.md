# Nythical Space Program

#### A Valkiriyan Skies Addon (for forge 1.20.1)



Welcome to Nythical Space Program (Working title, I don't want to be that much of a rip-off). A minecraft mod that aims to make space exploration challenging not through hard to get recipes or rare items but through you having to build Rockets taking into consideration the Thrust to weight ratio, delta-V and Rocket Staging etc...

With all the expected features such as time warp, a solar system map screen, maneuver nodes, seamlessly switching between different satellites, At least a dozen planetary bodies,
and multiplayer! (with global time warp with a voting system not the different timelines like the KSP multiplayer mod.) 
Set in a truly big Solar System with planets millions of kms away. Currently at the beginning stages of work, but you are welcome to look through the source code.
